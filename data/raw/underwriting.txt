Introduction																																										
We have reviewed the condensed consolidated financial statements of Haier Smart Home Co., Ltd. (the "

) set out on pages II-3 to II-39, which comprise the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of 30 September 2020 and the related condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for nine-month period then ended, and certain explanatory notes. The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited require the preparation of a report on interim financial information to be in compliance with the relevant provisions thereof and International Accounting Standard 34 																																										
Interim Financial Reporting " ("																																										
IAS 34																																										
) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review, and to report our conclusion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with our agreed terms of engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report.																																										
Scope of Review	Scope of Review	SKIP																																								
We conducted our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410 "																																										
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity " ("																																										
HKSRE 2410																																										
) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of these condensed consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.																																										
Conclusion	Conclusion	SKIP																																								
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34.
